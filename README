simple file and device shredder - very lightweight gnu shred alternative

forked from tfcrypt with idea of using Threefish for fast shredding.

I found this tool useful even before, but it existed only in gnu coreutils, and nowhere else.
Busybox also missed it, but I did not wanted to install coreutils on my musl sane systems,
but I was in a need for one and decided to write my own quickly.

It was used for more that three years and it proven to be stable enough.

BUGS:
- force option (-f) cannot force to overwrite _existing_ file if user does not own it, but
owns the directory where it resides. This is because common Unix systems lack a sane
way to transfer ownership of such files to user who owns directory. There is no fix for that.

LICENSE:
- Public domain code.
