shred -- gnu shred(1) tiny stable compatible alternative.

shred is a secure file destroying tool. It will overwrite the condemned file with garbage
and repeated patterns, and it will decide what to write randomly.

This tool exists mainly in gnu coreutils, and nowhere else.
Busybox also missed it (as of 1.20.1), and I did not wanted to install coreutils on my
musl systems at the time of writing this one.
While I do not use a musl based system anymore as of today, I still find this tool useful.
It is easy to compile and put it to systems which do miss it (for example, Android phones).
